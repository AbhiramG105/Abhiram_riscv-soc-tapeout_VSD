Welcome to my repository for the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** organized by **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.  
Here, I‚Äôll be documenting my progress throughout the program in a week-by-week format, with each section capturing the tasks, solutions, and key learnings along the way. This repo is meant to serve as a **personal logbook and reference point**, showing how the journey unfolds from setup to final outcomes.

## üöÄ Program Overview  
In this program, we learn to design a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** from **basic RTL to GDSII** using open-source tools.  
This initiative is part of **India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout program**, empowering **3500+ participants** to build silicon and contribute to the nation‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem.  

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure  
The repository is organized on a **week-wise basis**.  
Each week will contain:  
- **Tasks** ‚Üí Officially assigned weekly objectives  
- **Solutions/Implementations** ‚Üí Code, design files, or experiments  
- **Documentation** ‚Üí Notes, explanations, and observations  

This main README serves as the **central dashboard** for navigating the repository.

## üß∞ Toolchain (RTL ‚Üí GDSII)

| Stage | Tool | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| RTL Synthesis | [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/) | Logic synthesis and technology mapping from Verilog/SystemVerilog (via UHDM) to a gate-level netlist using Liberty timing libraries. |
| Floorplanning | [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/) | Die/core sizing, macro placement, power distribution network planning, and initial design constraints. |
| Placement | [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/) | Global and detailed placement with timing-driven optimization and congestion management. |
| Clock Tree Synthesis | [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/) | Clock network synthesis with buffer/inverter insertion to meet skew and latency targets. |
| Routing | [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/) | Global and detailed routing to produce a DRC-clean routed DEF based on PDK rules. |
| Static Timing | [OpenSTA](https://theopenroadproject.org/) | Static Timing Analysis for setup/hold closure using Liberty models and parasitics when available. |
| Physical Verification | [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/) | Design Rule Checking (DRC) and interactive layout edits; antenna and geometry rule checks. |
| LVS | [Netgen](http://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen/) | Layout-vs-Schematic comparison between the extracted layout netlist and the synthesized netlist. |
| Parasitic Extraction | [OpenROAD (SPEF/RCX)](https://theopenroadproject.org/) | RC parasitic extraction to generate SPEF for timing correlation and signoff refinement. |
| GDS Export & View | [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de/) | Final GDSII visualization, layer map inspection, and sanity checks before tapeout packaging. |
| Flow Orchestration | [OpenLane](https://theopenroadproject.org/openlane/) | Automated, reproducible RTL-to-GDSII pipeline coordinating the above tools via configurable stages. |
